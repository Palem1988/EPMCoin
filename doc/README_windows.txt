Extreme Private Masternode Coin
=====================

Intro
-----
EXTREME_PRIVATE_MASTERNODE is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run extreme_private_masternode-qt.exe.

Extreme Private Masternode Coin is the original Extreme Private Masternode client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Extreme Private Masternode transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
